I'm doing this on a lark and don't care about exposing the code to the
world, so I'm just making this repo public.  Do whatever you want with
it.  This file is basically just notes to myself.

Basically like a madlib style site in roughly this format:

- "n things" -

There's a form that's kind of like a mad lib something like this:
      The _3_ thing(s) that _all_ _programmers_ should _know_ but probably _don't_ are:
      1. _____
      2. _____
      3. _____

Anyway each ____ slot would be filled accordingly so the first one
would just determine how many items in the list (probably 1-100 would
be reasonable values) ... the next box would have like (all, every,
any, each, etc) the next would be a blank space to type something like
"programmers", "poker players", etc., the next one could have like a
dropdown list of pre-filled values like ([not] know, do, watch, learn,
read, internalize, etc) but also have an option for "other" that lets
you write in an answer, and the last could be like (don't, should,
shouldn't, etc) or write-in.

Hook in through facebook I guess.
