Basically like a madlib style site in roughly this format:

- "3 things" -

There's a form that's kind of like a mad lib something like this:
      The _3_ thing(s) that _all_ _programmers_ should _know_ but probably _don't_ are:
      1. _____
      2. _____
      3. _____

Anyway each ____ slot would be filled accordingly so the first one
would just determine how many items in the list (probably 1-100 would
be reasonable values) ... the next box would have like (all, every,
any, each, etc) the next would be a blank space to type something like
"programmers", "poker players", etc., the next one could have like a
dropdown list of pre-filled values like ([not] know, do, watch, learn,
read, internalize, etc) but also have an option for "other" that lets
you write in an answer, and the last could be like (don't, should,
shouldn't, etc) or write-in.

Hook in through facebook I guess.
